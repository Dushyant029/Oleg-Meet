<h1 align="center">Oleg Meet WebApp</h1>

**Oleg** is a web app which helps to make 1:1 interview session which instantly create a meeting link to join which consist of a clean UI/UX design. The front end is build using ReactJS, NodeJS and MaterialUI libraries. The back-end was built with Express. I used Socket.io to facilitate realtime communication between client and server, jsPDF, Quill for generating PDFs and Also I used simple-Peer API to establish a P2P data stream connection to a remote peer and GitHub for version control.

## Inspiration 👨‍🏫
The inspiration for this project was my own experience. In the present pandemic scenario, majority of the companies are preferring Online Interviews for the recruitment process, as it is more convenient and cost-effective for both – the recruiters & the job seekers. To help you to make meetings more productive and immersive, I made a web app that allows to connect recruiters & job seekers.

## What it does 🙄
Oleg Meet is a web app which helps to make 1:1 interview session which instantly create a meeting link to join which consist of a clean UI/UX design.

## How we built it 🤔
The front end is build using ReactJS, NodeJS and MaterialUI libraries. The back-end was built with Express. I used Socket.io to facilitate realtime communication between client and server, jsPDF, Quill for generating PDFs and Also I used simple-Peer API to establish a P2P data stream connection to a remote peer and GitHub for version control. 

## Challenges we ran into 😣
I mostly had issues with incorporating back-end code with the front-end code. I able to work with the app running up locally, but weren't able to deploy it in Netlify facing production build issues. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
 At some point, I wanted to give up. But I didn’t! I am glad that I have learned so much through the project and happy with the results.
 
## What we learned 🏫
I learned about the basics of Quill, simple-Peer API and also discovered a lot of resources thanks to the workshop and the mentors.

## What's next for Oleg Meet 🤩
I hope to fully develop this project into a usable end product by exploring the deployment part and providing few more features like screen share, ratings, reviews and further more improvement.
